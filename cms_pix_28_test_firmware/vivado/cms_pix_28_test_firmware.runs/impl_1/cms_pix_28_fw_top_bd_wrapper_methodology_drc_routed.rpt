2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and clk_pl_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_0] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_1 and clk_pl_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_1] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and clk_pl_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_0] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_1 and clk_pl_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_1] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on scan_out relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on bxclk relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on bxclk_ana relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on reset_not relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on scan_in relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on scan_load relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on super_pixel_sel relative to clock(s) clk_pl_1
Related violations: <none>
